We have a message, we have a vibe
We have a fire burning inside
We are a future, we are numb
We have instructions, but we are dumb

Flashing lights that pass us by
Create illusion, let's all get high
Overthinking, just let go
Listen to voices on the radio

Slide away with me tonight
Follow the stars, follow the light
Slide away with me tonight
Follow the stars, follow the light

We have a broadcast, we have a sound
We are the product of the underground
Slowly sinking into the unknown
Floating on air heavier than stone

Flashing lights that pass us by
Create illusion, let's all get high
Overthinking, just let go
Listen to voices on the radio

Slide away with me tonight
Follow the stars, follow the light
Slide away with me tonight
Follow the stars, follow the light

Slide away with me tonight
Follow the stars, follow the light
Slide away with me tonight
Follow the stars, follow the light
