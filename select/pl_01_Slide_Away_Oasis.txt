slide away
and give it all you got
mine today, fell in from the top
I dream of you
and all the things you say
I wonder were you are now
hold me down
all the worlds asleep
need you now
you knocked me off my feet
I dream of you
and we talked of growing old
but you said please don't
slidin' baby
together we'll fly
I tried prayin'
but I don't what you say to me
but now that you're mine
we'll find a way
of chasing the sun
let me be the one
who shines with you
in the morning
we don't know what to do
do what we can
we'll find a way
do what we done
let me be the one
who shines with you
and let me slide away
slide away slide away away
<♪>
slide away
give it all you got
mine today, fell in from the top
I dream of you
and all the things you say
I wonder were you are now
slidin' baby together we'll fly
I tried prayin'
and I know just
what you say to me
now that you're mine
we'll find a way
of chasing the sun
let me be the one
who shines with you
in the morning
we don't know what to do
do what we can
we'll find a way
do what we done
oh let me be the one
who shines with you
and we can slide away
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
<♪>
don't know, don't care
you can take me there
don't know, don't care
all I know is that
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
slide away slide away
